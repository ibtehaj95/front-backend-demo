# frontend-backend-demo

A project with a barebones backend, created as a pratice project for an interview preparation. The backend is made on Express, using an NEDB database. In its current state it is possible to enter data in the "Report Debris" section (accessible via the sidebar) and see it in the "View Ongoing Operations" section.

This project is a work-in-progress and, by no means, a finished project.
